*** Observation ***
Oberservation of property. Notice of Violation not warranted at this time.

*** 302.5 Rodent Harborage ***
All structures and exterior property shall be kept free from rodent harborage and infestation.  Where rodents are found, they shall be promply exterminated by approved processes which will not be injurious to human health.  After pest elimination, proper precautions shall be taken to eliminate rodent harborage and prevent reinfestation.

Based upon neighbor complaints regarding the garage door always being left open at parcel ID 373-D-76 in the Township of Wilkins, on this date it was observed that the garage door was open and along with having a rubbish container kept in close proximity to the open garage could be a potential for rodent harborage.  Having such conditions would be a violation of Township ordinances.  It is recommended to close the garage door when not in use to prevent rodent harborage. 

If you have any questions regarding this issue please feel free to contact me at a time which is convenient for you and I would be happy to discuss the matter in greater detail.

On this date I stopped in to follow up on the progress of conditions from the initial notice dated 6/23/2015 concerning the excess water accumulated on the cover of the in-ground pool that is not in use.  I saw that water was being pumped from the pool on 6/30/2015 but with recent rain and an additional complaint from the Borough I wanted to see how much water had accumulated again.  

My observation concluded that water had again accumulated in the unused pool and will require draining to maintain sanitary conditions and prevent potential insect infestation due to stagnant water.  Also observed was the weeds / grass on the property were in excess of six inches and will require to be maintained.  During our conversation you had stated your brother David would help maintain the grass.  

In conclusion please maintain sanitary conditions by keeping stagnant water from accumulating in the unused swimming pool and keep the grass / weeds to a height of less than six inches.

I explained that you would be receiving another notice dated 7/7/2015 stating you are still in violation since the rear yard portion is still in excess of six inches of which you stated you didn't know the back had to be maintained as well.  You also stated that due to recent medical conditions in conjunction with not being able to get transportation or drive you could only make it to this property every 2-3 weeks.  

I informed you that the next step of the process if not in compliance with the ordinance was to issue a citation for the condition of high weeds.  You stated you would have the front and rear yards maintained before 8/1/2015 and I am acceptable to the extended timeframe.

This notice is being sent on behalf of the Borough of Churchill.  A violation of the Churchill Borough Code (""Code"") was observed on property located at 42 Churchill Rd on 5/3/2016 at approximately 2:00pm. 

*** Chapter 236 Article II Property Maintenance Code ***

*** §302.2 Grading and Drainage ***
All premises shall be graded and maintained to prevent the erosion of soil and to prevent the accumulation of stagnant water thereon, or within any structure located thereon.

On 5/3/2016 it was observed that soil was being eroded and accumulated on the access drive of this property in violation of the Code.  It appears that when the section of damaged retaining wall was removed in August of 2015 and subsequently not repaired or rebuilt has created a condition causing the erosion of soil from the hillside and from beneath the upper portion of Churchill Road.  The eroded soil washes down and is accumulating along the private access drive in the front of your property.  A remedy will need to be put in place to keep the soil and rest of the hillside from eroding and or causing more of the retaining wall from being compromised.  Please repair or replace the damaged section of the retaining wall located on the front of your property.  I stopped this date to discuss this issue but there was no answer at the front.

You have fortyfive (45) days to comply with this notice.  Failure to comply may result in additional notices, citations, fines and/or a lien may be placed upon the property.

You have the right to an appeal to the International Property Maintenance Code Board of Appeals.  The appeal must be filed with the Turtle Creek Valley Council of Governments at 2700 Monroeville Boulevard Monroeville, PA 15146, within 20 days of the mailing of this notice.
